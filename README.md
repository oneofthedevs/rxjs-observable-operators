# rxjs Operators 

Here's a small project, I had as an assignment which gives a brief idea about Observable, Subject and BehaviorSubject, also some of the commonly used rxjs operators.

### I divided the assignment into 3 tasks

#### Task 1: Creating observables

This just has 2 functions which gives you an idea about how to create an observable and what exactly next(), error() and complete() does

#### Task 2: Observable vs Subject and BehaviorSubject

This is a little a example to give a basic idea of what observable, subject and behaviorSubject is and how they differ from one another 

#### Task 3: rxjs operators: map, switchMap, filter, find, forkJoin and merge
Here I have used SWAPI (Star Wars API) and Check Norris Joke API to give some idea of how we can combine these operators to get our desired results while working on live projects

#### FYI: I only had like 4 hours to develop this, so sorry if I missed something important or if something isn't correct.
